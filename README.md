# leaflet-challenge
For the Module 15 challende, I designed an earthquake app to pull in data from the USGS earthquake site, mapped recent earthquakes, set size according to magnitude, set color according to depth, and set a legend to correspond to depths on the map. 

The stack includes Javascript, Leaflet.js, D3.js, HTML, and CSS.
