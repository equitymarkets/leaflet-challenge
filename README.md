# Earthquakes in North America!
For the Module 15 challenge, I designed an earthquake app to pull in data from the USGS earthquake site, mapped recent earthquakes, set size according to magnitude, set color according to depth, and set a legend to correspond to depths on the map. 

The stack includes Javascript, Leaflet.js, D3.js, HTML, and CSS. 

Part II is coming soon.
